            Junput, also spelled as Junputh or Junpore, is a coastal village located in the Purba Medinipur district of the Indian state of West Bengal. Situated near the Bay of Bengal, Junput is known for its serene beaches and tranquil surroundings. It is a popular tourist destination, particularly among those seeking a quieter alternative to more crowded beaches.

            Junput offers visitors a chance to relax on its sandy shores, enjoy views of the sea, and indulge in activities like swimming, beachcombing, and sunbathing. The beach is relatively less developed compared to other tourist spots, which adds to its charm for those looking for a peaceful getaway.
            
            Apart from its natural beauty, Junput also has historical significance. It is said that Junput was once a port town during the British colonial period and played a role in maritime trade. Today, remnants of its past can still be seen in the form of old structures and fishing boats dotting the coastline.
