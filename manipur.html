            Loktak Lake, situated in Manipur, India, is the largest freshwater lake in Northeast India, known for its floating islands called "phumdis" and the unique Sangai deer found in its vicinity. It serves as a crucial biodiversity hotspot and a source of livelihood for local communities engaged in fishing and tourism activities. Visitors can enjoy boat rides, birdwatching, and serene views of the lake and its surroundings throughout the year.
            months:The best time to visit Loktak Lake is during the dry season, which typically lasts from November to March.Loktak Lake is the largest freshwater lake in Northeast India, located in the state of Manipur. It is famous for its unique floating islands, known as "phumdis," which are composed of vegetation, soil, and organic matter. These phumdis float on the surface of the lake, varying in size and thickness, and provide habitat for diverse flora and fauna.

            One of the most remarkable features of Loktak Lake is the Keibul Lamjao National Park, which is located within the lake and is the world's only floating national park. The park is primarily known for being the last natural refuge of the endangered Manipur brow-antlered deer, also known as the Sangai. The Sangai deer is the state animal of Manipur and is considered sacred by the local communities.

            It seems there might be some confusion. As of my last update, there isn't a national park by the name "Sirohi National Park." However, there are several national parks and wildlife sanctuaries in India, such as Sariska National Park and Ranthambore National Park in Rajasthan. If you're referring to a different location or if Sirohi National Park is a new addition, I recommend checking the latest travel resources for accurate information.
            months:the best time to visit is during the winter months from October to March.Sirohi National Park is located in the Terai region of Nepal, near the border with India. It is part of the Terai Arc Landscape, a conservation area that spans across Nepal and India and is known for its rich biodiversity, particularly in terms of wildlife.
            The national park is characterized by its diverse habitats, including tropical forests, grasslands, and wetlands, which support a wide variety of plant and animal species. It is home to several endangered and iconic species, including the Bengal tiger, Asian elephant, one-horned rhinoceros, and sloth bear.
