            The Elephant Falls, located near Shillong in Meghalaya, is a picturesque waterfall named after a rock resembling an elephant near its foot. Visitors can enjoy the stunning cascade of water surrounded by lush greenery and rock formations. The falls are accessible year-round, 
 months:the best time to visit is during the monsoon season (June to September) when the waterfall is at its most magnificent. However, exercise caution as the trails can be slippery during this time.The name "Elephant Falls" is derived from a local Khasi legend that tells the story of an elephant-shaped rock near the falls, which unfortunately was destroyed in an earthquake. Despite the loss of the distinctive rock formation, the name "Elephant Falls" has endured and continues to be used to refer to the cascades.

 The Elephant Falls is actually a series of three falls that cascade down a rocky gorge, each offering a different vantage point and perspective of the stunning natural scenery. The first of the three falls is the tallest and most prominent, with water plunging down in a single majestic drop. The second and third falls are smaller but equally picturesque, surrounded by lush greenery and rocky outcrops.
